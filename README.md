 # Introduction 
 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected our daily lives. This data analysis aims to provide an exploratory examination of infection rates, deaths, and vaccination rates. 
 Additionally, special attention will be given to the impacts of COVID-19 on the island of Puerto Rico, as it holds personal significance as my birthplace.  
 
 Tools used: 
 * Microsoft Excel
 * SQL Server Management Studio
 * [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/CovidProject_16816646606030/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
 
 ### The Data
I utilized a dataset from Our World in Data, a non-profit scientific online publication website that addresses critical global issues, including poverty, disease, hunger, climate change, war, existential risks, and inequality. You can access the dataset through this link: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.  
	
The dataset I used is extensive and has been consistently updated on a daily basis since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. For my analysis, I specifically focused on key aspects of the dataset, including population, dates, locations, cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
